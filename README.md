<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<p id="install"></p>


<p id="linux"></p>

# Linux

```
The root user directly executes the following commands, and selects the corresponding function according to the prompts.

bash <(curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JackLeiMinerProxy/KTMinerProxy/main/linux-install.sh)
```
### After the installation is complete, please modify the login account, password and startup port immediately to prevent explosion.

go to<a href="https://github.com/JackLeiMinerProxy/KTMinerProxy/tree/main/KENC">https://github.com/JackLeiMinerProxy/KTMinerProxy/tree/main/KENC</a>Download it yourself
</p>
<p><a href="#kenc">KENC Help Documentation</a></p>


<p id="question"></p>
<p id="about"></p>

# common problem

<span id="q0"></span>
## Process daemon
<p>The program comes with a process guard, don't! don't want! Do not use supervisor or related tools to maintain the process, otherwise it will cause the process to be started repeatedly. </p>

<span id="q1"></span>
## The computing power is wavy
<img src="./image/t10.png" alt="Logo"><br>
<p>If the situation in the above figure appears, it means that you have opened multiple KTMinerproxy with the same port, and you can close the redundant processes. </p>
<p>If you make a mirror copy, the above problems will also occur. First execute the script to stop the program, then delete the /root/ktmproxy/license file, and then execute the startup.</p>

<span id="q2"></span>
## load balancing
<p>...</p>

<span id="q3"></span>
## When installing, it prompts curl: command not found
<p>The installation prompts curl: command not found, indicating that your linux does not have curl installed</p>
<p>Execute apt-get update first</p>
<p>Then execute apt install curl</p>
<p>Wait for the command to complete, then execute the installation script</p>

<span id="q4"></span>
## Modify the port to start
<p>Execute the installation script, choose to modify the port to start, and enter the port number to be modified. </p>

<span id="q5"></span>
## change Password
<p>After installation, please go to the settings page as soon as possible to change the password. </p>

<span id="q6"></span>
## prompt dial tcp connection refused at startup
<p>Please add ktproxy.com to the firewall whitelist, this domain provides chart service and authentication</p>

<span id="q7"></span>
## close/delete port
<img src="./image/t11.png" alt="Logo">
<p>Click the specified location in the picture to delete/close the port</p>

<span id="q8"></span>
## Installation prompt: install killall failed! ! ! !
<p>Check the server's mirror source and install psmisc manually</p>

<span id="q9"></span>
## WEB access is stuck in the LOADING interface for a long time.
<p>After installation or update, it may take a long time to load the web interface for the first time. If you haven't accessed it for a long time, please change the chrome browser. </p>

<span id="q1"></span>
## Default account password
<p>Default account: admin</p>
<p>Default password: admin123</p>

<span id="q10"></span>
## Computational power loss
<p></p>
<p>A variety of reasons can cause loss of computing power, check the following items, and don't deduct any shit from developers</p>
<p></p>
<p>Observe the proportion of the delay share in the mining pool, if the delay rate is higher than 1%, please ping the server to check the delay</p>
<p></p>
<p>The computing power of pumping varies from pool to pool. If the difficulty of the two pools is different, it will also lead to differences in computing power</p>

<span id="q11"></span>
## IP blacklist
<p></p>
<p> Go to the settings page, the IP blacklist tab can actively join the IP blacklist</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="./image/jt18.png"></p>
<p></p>

<span id="q12"></span>
## ETH, ETC chip machine
<p></p>
<p> Common models such as Cow, Jasmine, Yami, etc. need to use the ETH port. For Innosil series or other models, please select the ETH (GetWork) port</p>
<p> If the device cannot be connected normally, try different types of ports alternately. </p>
<p></p>

<span id="q18"></span>
## Innosilicon A11 series related issues
<p></p>
<p> The A11 pumping pool needs to be the same as the target mining pool. </p>
<p> If there is still high invalidation in the same pool, please downgrade or upgrade the firmware to a11_20211026_060307 version, mx needs to downgrade or upgrade to a11mx_20211220_124402 version. </p>
<p></p>

<span id="q13"></span>
## Local computing power modification
<p></p>
<p> When adding or editing ports, the local computing power of ETH and ETC can be modified under the [Advanced] tab</p>
<p></p>

<span id="q14"></span>
## service migration
<p></p>
<p> No matter what method is used to migrate the program, please delete the license file in the new directory after the migration, and then restart the program</p>
<p></p>

<span id="q15"></span>
## memory related
<p></p>
<p>At present, the peak memory usage of a single device is controlled at 1.5M, and it is in the long-term observation and adjustment stage. After that, the usage will be reduced according to the actual situation. Please determine the hardware configuration according to the number of connected devices</p>
<p></p>

<span id="q16"></span>
## Observer link
<p></p>
<p> Open Port Settings - Advanced Settings, find the watcher link, open and save it, and find the watcher link in the lower left corner of the port details page. </p>

<span id="q17"></span>
## Common reasons for insufficient computing power
<p>If the gap between the 24-hour average and the setting is too large after testing, for example, the setting is 1%, but the average is much less. There are many reasons for this to happen, and you need to check it step by step. </p>
<p>Usually check whether the local is hit or not, or if there is a problem with the equipment. For example, some equipment in the transfer is inefficient and very inefficient. In this case, there is usually a problem with the card. It is usually easier to troubleshoot when it is found. In KT Find the device with high invalidity, click it to see if there are many POW-related keywords in the log, if there is, it means that the hardware of this device has a problem, resulting in the invalidity and low computing power. </p>
<p>A more common reason is the local attack, which is very easy to encounter but difficult to troubleshoot. You can create a pure forwarding port in the KT, and use the pure forwarding port to test the 24-hour average of the device. If the port is not running enough for 24 hours, then there is a high probability that it is a local attack, and the local reinstallation of the clean system will solve the problem. </p>
